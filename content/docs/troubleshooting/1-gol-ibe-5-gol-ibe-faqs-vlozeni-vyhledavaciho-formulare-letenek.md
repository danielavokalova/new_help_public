FYI: The form includes HTML, CSS, pictures and relevant scripts for implementation into your website, including the full functionality of the destination search tooltip. You can customize the form as you wish.

The result may look like e.g. this way:

**2.iframe**

Another option is the iframe which offers an easy implementation, however it does have some disadvantages. For example, if your customers search for an open-jaw flight and they keep adding more and more flights, the form will keep extending and you either need to leave enough space on your website, or allow scrolling. Neither looks very nice.

Here's an example of the implementation.

Just enter the following code into your existing webpage:

 *\<iframe src=*[*https://xxx.golibe.com/iframe*](https://xxx.golibe.com/iframe) *width="100%" height="565px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency=true>\</iframe>*

**For geeks: Customize the default settings of the search form**

In both above cases, parameters of the search form can be predefined and your customers then see them pre-filled.

The easiest way to find out how to create the link is to:

* Set up the search form the way you want to predefine the search.
* Search and get to the page with search results.
* Find the button *New search* that would normally get you back to the search form, right-click on it and click *Copy link*.

Examples of what you'll get:

`https://xxxx.golibe.com/index.php?action=vFlights&flights[0][origin]=PRG&flights[0][destination]=LON&flights[0][departureDate]=2013-01-09&flights[1][origin]=LON&flights[1][destination]=PRG&flights[1][departureDate]=2013-01-16&searchType=FromFour&travelers[0]=ADT&dateVariants=exact&returnTicket=on&step=one2`

If you want to predefine the search form for PRG-LON, omit other parameters in the URL (such as the date) and keep only the relevant part. You can then use the amended URL as a link:

```http
?action=vFlights&flights[0][origin]=PRG&flights[0][destination]=LON&flights[1][origin]=LON&flights[1][destination]=PRG&searchType=FromFour&travelers[0]=ADT&dateVariants=exact&returnTicket=on&step=one2
```

...or use it in the iframe:

If you want to redirect your customers straight to the search results and let them wait on the waiting page instead of displaying a blank page, you can add a redirection. Caution: the part after "...redirect=" must be an encoded URL. For example:

```
https://xxxx.golibe.com/index.php?action=vWait&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fxxxx.golibe.com%2Findex.php%3Faction%3DvFlights%26flights%5B0%5D%5BdepartureDate%5D%3D2014-11-07%26flights%5B0%5D%5Bdestination%5D%3DPTP%26flights%5B0%5D%5Borigin%5D%3DPAR%26flights%5B0%5D%5BdeparturePlusMinusDay%5D%3D3%26flights%5B1%5D%5BdepartureDate%5D%3D2014-11-14%26flights%5B1%5D%5Bdestination%5D%3DPAR%26flights%5B1%5D%5Borigin%5D%3DPTP%26flights%5B1%5D%5BdeparturePlusMinusDay%5D%3D3%26travelers%5B0%5D%3DADT%26returnTicket%3Don%26vendor%3DTX%26dateVariants%3Dclose%26step%3DChooseFromFour%26target%3Dflights
